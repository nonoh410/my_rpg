PETER: Hello Dybdyb. I was told to come see you, that you might need help. - DYBDYB: Me need help??? Not at all ! I'm doing just fine on my own!! - PETER: I didn't mean to offend you...I just wanted to give you a little help. Once upon a time I was a great warrior in the village. - DYBDYB: Well... are you sure you want to fight? - PETER: 100%!! - DYBDYB: Ok then prepare yourself well, the attack may be imminent. I am going to rest a bit. Go fight for me. I give you my weapon: A super powerful sword! Be careful with it!! - PETER: Wow she's gorgeous!! - DYBDYB: You just have to go to the end of the forbidden forest. There, you will see the bad guys coming. - PETER: Thank you very much DYBDYB. I'm ready for the fight! - DYBDYB: Good luck!
