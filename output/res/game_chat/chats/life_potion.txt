- MONT PAIRE: Hello Peter, it's been a long time since I've seen you... How are you? - PETER: Hello Sir, I think I'm fine thank you... I'm sorry but I don't remember you... - MONT PAIRE: No worries Peter, I'm Mont Paire, the village priest. I can give you life potions if you want. It can boost you if you need more life in a fight. - PETER: Oh yes Mont Paire, with great pleasure thank you very much! What do you think I should do, or who should I see now? - MONT PAIRE: You should go talk to the village guardian, Dybdyb. He must be at the Forbidden Forest waiting for the bad guys. I don't think he would say no to a little help! Plus he can give you a gun! - PETER: Thank you very much Mont Paire!
