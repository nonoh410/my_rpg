- PETER: But... Where am I ? Is anyone here?  OHHHH??!?! - PAULO: Hello Peter. Do you remember who I am? - PETER: Uhhh no... Who are you? - PAULO: I'm Paulo, the village chief. - PETER: Your face looks familiar... Have I been here before? - PAULO: Yes Peter, you were our bravest warrior... So you don't remember at all? - PETER: No, I don't remember... What happened? - PAULO: Our island has the largest diamond reserve in the world. So many robbers want to steal from us constantly. During the last attack you defended us like a brave warrior. Unfortunately you were hit on the head and lost your memory. - PETER: I see! But what are our defenses and what can I do now? - PAULO: We have installed barriers all around the village. This is to prevent any intrusion. However, sometimes some bad guys break into our security system and want to rob us. Usually they enter from the SOUTH EAST of our village. That's why that the houses of the village are separated from this place by the "Impenetrable Forest". But enough talk. Visit our beautiful village and go talk to our villagers to try to get some souvenirs. The villagers will give you something to fill your inventory with. And be prepared for any new attacks. It could happen at any time! - PETER: Okay, Paulo. Thank you so much! I'll get ready.
